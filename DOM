(DOM) â€“ Document object model
--it is used in web development used to interact and manipulate(change)the html documents.
When the web page is loaded, the browser created DOM of the webpage
When the html file is loaded into the browser , the java script cannot understand the html document directly.

Key points:
1)	Structure: The DOM represents the structure of HTML documents as a tree. Each node in a tree represents the elements, an attribute or text
2)	Manipulation: Using java script , you can interact with elements (buttons, paragraphs) on the webpage, changing the content  styles, can add or remove elements.
3)	 Event handling: you can handle the interactions, like click or pressing the button
4)	W3C (world wide web consortium)
